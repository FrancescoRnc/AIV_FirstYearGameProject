# Game project

This is my first game made in C# Used to test what i learned from the first year in AIV Rome.

## Development
Its develop has lasted from August 2018 'til October 2018, when i started the second year on AIV, pausing it for the moment.

## Languages used
I wrote the code only on C# and some XML for managing images, text files and more, but i would like to use other languages to make it cooler and performing.

## Assets
Unfortunately i had to recycle image and sound assets from Internet 'cause i'm not an artist
(but i made by myself the life bars, buttons with an existing font and the blue enemy warning on left/right).

## Next try

Fear not! I've in mind to heavily improve this game, creating another separated project maybe, with better skills, more tools,better quality assets and more ideas!
